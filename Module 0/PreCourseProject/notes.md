## ***Projects are due the Friday BEFORE your start day***

- **Your project folder must include—and you must be able to explain—the following:**

1. **index.html**
    1. Your HTML file will contain the content of your web app: words, images, links, and so forth. Any amount will do.
    2. A [<link>](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp) that references a separate CSS file that adds styling to the HTML elements of your web app. ****DO NOT add CSS styles directly to your HTML file.***
    3. A [<script>](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_src.asp) that references a separate JavaScript file that adds interaction/functionality to your web application. ****DO NOT add JavaScript code directly to your HTML file.***
2. **styles.css**
    1. Any amount of CSS you’d like to add to your project to style it, but there should at least be *some* styling added.
    2. An HTML element should be referenced and styled in CSS
    3. A class should be referenced and styled in CSS
3. **app.js**
    1. Be able to **identify** the following data types and notations:
        - Strings
        - Numbers
        - Booleans
        - Arrays (Why are they useful? What does “0-indexed” mean?)
        - Objects
    2. **Use** each of the following in your app.js file:	
        - Create an object and navigate that object using dot notation.
        - Create an array and navigate that array using bracket notation.
        - A conditional statement (if, else if, else)
        - A for loop OR a while loop
        - An [addEventListener](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_addeventlistener.asp) method to call a [function](https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cLrMenHv)

*Note: As the foundation of the course we are dedicated to helping you understand and use vanilla JavaScript, **please don’t use Bootstrap, jQuery or any other dependencies/libraries in your project.***

*The requirements listed are all that matter. It does not matter if someone told you different than what is outlined here. These are the requirements.*

**Our main focus will be the functionality of the JS and your ability to explain it. ****Your project can be very simple as long as it includes each of the requirements above. We won’t be looking too closely at the styling or design of it, although you’re welcome to spend time working on that as well.*
