Write a function that takes two arrays as parameters. The first array will be an array of people's names, and the second array will be the alphabet. Using a for loop within a for loop, create and return array that looks like this:

### **A Bigger Picture:**

This assignment is a little bit silly.

### **If you get stuck:**

You should be getting use to this pattern already. Define the accumulator and run your for loop on your array to build the accumulator.

In this case, you'll do on action in one of the for loops. That same for loop will have a nested for loop.

You will write a line of code that will run inside the nested for loop. 26 times (don't hard code it!) for every name that the parent, or outer array, runs a loop for.
