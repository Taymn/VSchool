Work through the 4 parts of the problem solving process the best you can with this one, but there is Part 2 explained in the Scrimba link for this Notion Page.

### **Project Requirements:**

**Description** 

The year is 1985. Your job is to build a text-based (console) RPG game. (Using readline-sync)

The point of this exercise is to better master Javascript functions, loops, conditionals, and some data types.

(**Total Story Points: 16**)

1. Console must greet player with a fun message

2. Console must ask for the player's name and store it 
    
    ### ***1 Story Point - Report as Story Point 83**
    
3. Walking 
- The console will ask the user to enter a "w" to walk
- Every time the player walks, a random algorithm will be run that determines if a wild enemy has appeared (A 1/3 or 1/4 chance of being attacked)
- Use a while loop to control this flow.

1. If a wild enemy appears
- The enemy is random (can be chosen out of a minimum of 3 different enemy names)
- The user can decide to attack or run
- If attacking, a random amount of damage will be dealt between a min and max
- If running, there will be a 50% chance of escaping
- After the player attacks or runs the enemy attacks back for a random damage amount
- The player and enemy will attack each other in a loop until one of them passes out or dies.
- If the player kills the enemy you can give the Player some HP and special item that is stored in the inventory . After this, the player will continue walking.
- If the enemy kills the player the console prints a cool death message and the game ends

1. Inventory 
- When the player kills enemies, they are awarded with items (optional)
- If the user enters 'Print' or 'p' in the console, the console will print the players name, HP, and each item in their inventory

### **Passing Criteria: Demo to the Instructor & Code Review**

An instructor will look through your code with you and make sure you have a solid grasp on using functions, loops, and conditionals in JavaScript, as well as to verify that you're following JavaScript code standards and good general programming practices.
