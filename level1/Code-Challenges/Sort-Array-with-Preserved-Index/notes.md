**Challenge: Sort Array with Preserved Index for -1 Values**
You are given an array `a` containing integers. Your task is to implement the `solution` function to sort the array in ascending order, while preserving the original index positions of -1 values.
Write a function `solution(a)` that takes in an array `a` and returns a new array with the following conditions:
- All non -1 values in the array should be sorted in ascending order.
- The -1 values should retain their original index positions in the sorted array.
