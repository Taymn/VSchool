When creating a local react environment there are two methods V School recommends. ************************************************Aside from projects within Scrimba, do all the assignments by creating a React app locally************************************************

1) npm create vite@latest // Vite
2) npx create-react-app APP-NAME  // Create React App

Instructions for both are below.  Feel free to try both!

IMPORTANT NOTE:   After watching the videos please see the Reactv v18 Update Documentation!!
