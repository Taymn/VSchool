Challenge: Build the Navbar component.
Check the Figma file for the design specifics.

Here are some pro tips for basic styling of a navbar in a React app:

1. **CSS Frameworks:** Consider using popular CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. They provide pre-built components and styling utilities for quickly creating a styled navbar.
2. **Separate Component:** Create a separate component for the navbar to keep the code organized and reusable.
3. **CSS Modules or Styled Components:** Utilize CSS Modules or Styled Components to encapsulate the navbar's styles within the component itself, avoiding global CSS clashes.
4. **Flexbox or Grid:** Use CSS flexbox or grid layout to easily align and position navbar items. Flexbox allows for flexible and responsive alignment, while grid offers more complex layout possibilities.
5. **Responsive Design:** Make the navbar responsive by using media queries or CSS frameworks' responsive classes to adapt to different screen sizes. Consider collapsing the navbar into a hamburger menu for smaller screens.
6. **Active Page Highlight:** Apply a different style to the active page's navbar link to provide visual feedback to users. You can achieve this by adding a CSS class dynamically based on the current active page or route.
7. **Hover Effects:** Add subtle hover effects to navbar links to improve interactivity. For example, changing the text color or background color on hover can provide visual cues to users.
8. **Transitions and Animations:** Apply smooth transitions or animations to navbar elements to enhance the user experience. For instance, animating the navbar height or fading in/out on scroll can create a polished effect.
9. **Custom Logo or Branding:** Customize the navbar by adding your app's logo or branding. Use appropriate CSS styles to position and size the logo within the navbar.
10. **Accessibility Considerations:** Ensure the navbar is accessible by using semantic HTML elements (e.g., **`<nav>`**, **`<ul>`**, **`<li>.`**
