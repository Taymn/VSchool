### Challenge: Project setup

1. Create a `components` folder
2. Create the following components in separate files inside the components folder. In each one, just render an `h1` with the name of the component (e.g. return `<h1>Navbar goes here</h1>`):
    - Navbar
    - Main
3. Create an App component outside the components folder (sibling to the index.js file)
4. Have App render the Navbar and Main components
5. Import and render the App component inside of index.js using ReactDOM
6. At this point you should have your "Navbar goes here" etc. showing up in the mini-browser.
7. Go to Google fonts and get the "Inter" font with weights 400, 600, and 700. Put the links to those fonts ABOVE the style.css link in index.html (Use the `<link/>` elements instead of the @import or npm options for getting the fonts. You may need to do some extra research to figure out how this works if you haven't done it before).
